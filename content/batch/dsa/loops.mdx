### Explore Different Types of Loops

In this section, you will dive into the various types of loops available in JavaScript, including:

- **For Loop**: Learn how to use the `for` loop to execute code repeatedly.
- **While Loop**: Understand the `while` loop and how it differs from the `for` loop.
- **Do-While Loop**: Explore the `do-while` loop and its unique characteristics.
- **Loop Control Statements**: Discover how to control loops using `break` and `continue` statements.

## üìù Study Notes

We've prepared detailed study notes to accompany the video. These notes cover essential concepts related to loops in JavaScript. Use them as a quick reference while learning or revising.

### The `for` Loop

The `for` loop is commonly used when you know the exact number of iterations you need. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment (or decrement).

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}

```
### The `for in` Loop

The JavaScript for in statement loops through the properties of an Object:

```javascript
const person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};

let text = "";
for (let x in person) {
  text += person[x];
}

```
### The `for of` Loop

The JavaScript for of statement loops through the values of an iterable object.

It lets you loop over iterable data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more:

```javascript
const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];

let text = "";
for (let x of cars) {
  text += x;
}

```

### The `while` Loop

The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

```javascript
while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}

```

### The ` do-while` Loop

The do while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

```javascript
do {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
while (i < 10);

```
### The `Break` Statement

The break statement can also be used to jump out of a loop

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 3) { break; }
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}

```

### The `continue` Statement

The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 3) { continue; }
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}

```

### Hands-On Assignments

To reinforce your understanding of loops, we have prepared the following assignments for you:


### 1. Print Numbers with `for` Loop

Write a `for` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5.
### 2. Countdown with `while` Loop

Create a `while` loop that counts down from 10 to 1.

### 3. Iterate Through an Array

Implement a `for` loop that iterates through an array and prints each element.

### 4. Validate User Age with `do-while` Loop

Write a `do-while` loop to prompt the user for their age until they enter a valid age (between 18 and 99).



### 5. Calculate Sum of Even Numbers

Create a `for` loop to calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 10.


### 6. Generate Random Numbers

Implement a `while` loop that generates random numbers between 1 and 100 until a number greater than 90 is generated.



Feel free to try these exercises and test your knowledge of JavaScript loops!

These assignments will help you solidify your knowledge of loops and improve your coding skills.
