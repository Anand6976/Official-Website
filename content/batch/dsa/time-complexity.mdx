    ## üìù Study Notes

    ### What is Time Complexity?
Time complexity is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the amount of time it takes to execute relative to the size of the input. It is expressed using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm's running time.

### Big O Notation
Big O notation is a way to describe the efficiency of an algorithm. It represents the upper bound of an algorithm's running time in terms of the size of the input. The most common time complexities are O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), and O(n^2).

### Constant Time Complexity - O(1)
Constant time complexity means that the running time of the algorithm does not depend on the size of the input. The algorithm takes the same amount of time to execute regardless of the size of the input.

```javascript
function constantTimeFunction() {
  console.log("This function has constant time complexity.");
}
```

### Linear Time Complexity - O(n)
Linear time complexity means that the running time of the algorithm is directly proportional to the size of the input. The algorithm takes longer to execute as the size of the input increases.

```javascript
function linearTimeFunction(n) {
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    console.log("This function has linear time complexity.");
  }
}
```

### Quadratic Time Complexity - O(n^2)
Quadratic time complexity means that the running time of the algorithm is proportional to the square of the size of the input. The algorithm takes much longer to execute as the size of the input increases.

```javascript
function quadraticTimeFunction(n) {
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      console.log("This function has quadratic time complexity.");
    }
  }
}
```

### Logarithmic Time Complexity - O(log n)
Logarithmic time complexity means that the running time of the algorithm grows logarithmically with the size of the input. The algorithm takes longer to execute, but the increase in time is slower than linear time complexity.

```javascript
function logarithmicTimeFunction(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i < n; i *= 2) {
    console.log("This function has logarithmic time complexity.");
  }
}
```

### Linearithmic Time Complexity - O(n log n)
Linearithmic time complexity means that the running time of the algorithm is proportional to n log n. This is a common time complexity for algorithms that divide the input into smaller pieces and process each piece linearly.

```javascript
function linearithmicTimeFunction(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return;
  const mid = Math.floor(n / 2);
  linearithmicTimeFunction(mid);
  linearithmicTimeFunction(n - mid);
  console.log("This function has linearithmic time complexity.");
}
```

    ### Trade-offs
    It's important to consider the trade-offs between time complexity and space complexity when designing algorithms. Sometimes, optimizing for one can result in a less optimal solution for the other.
